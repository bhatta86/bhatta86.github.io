### Modeling and Predicting Human Mobility Patterns: A Data-Driven Approach

Human mobility is the study of individual and collective human movement in space and time, in the case of this project, population flow amongst various geolocations. The goal of this project was to model and predict human mobility patterns on the scale of groups throughout the COVID-19 timeline. 

**Dataset Utilized**: [COVID19USFlows - Weekly Flows](https://github.com/GeoDS/COVID19USFlows-WeeklyFlows/tree/master)

**Data Handling**: Weekly CSV updates were combined and split into training (Jan 2019 - Jun 2021) and testing (Jul 2021 - Dec 2021) sets using Pandas.

**Methodology**: Trained two different models, one with Random Forest Regression, and another with Gradient Boosting Regression, in order to be able to predict future population flows. 

**Performance**:
- **Random Forest**:  Relative Error - 0.04% 
- **Gradient Boosting**: Relative Error - 163.95%

**Further Thoughts**: Future improvements within this project could be to develop a neural network so that data anomalies can be handled with greater intelligence, as opposed to training a machine learning model. Furthermore, many jumps in the data were present due to holidays, events, natural disasters, and more, so these areas could be filtered out.
