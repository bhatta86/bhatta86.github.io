Hello, I'm Rishabh Bhattarai, a junior majoring in Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan College of Engineering. Originally from Kalamazoo, Michigan, I’m driven by a fascination with how hardware and software come together to form the foundation of modern technology. My long-term goal is to pursue graduate studies and work in a field related to VLSI and hardware engineering. 

I currently work as a System Engineering Co-op at **Sierra Nevada Corporation**, where I've been developing SysML-based system engineering templates, and working on MBSE projects for aerospace and defense systems.

Before SNC, I worked in various tech roles such as a SharePoint Developer at MSU's Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), and a PC Technician at MSU's Surplus Store & Recycling Center. Throughout all my tech-adjacent experiences, I've gained skills in hardware/software engineering, system-level design, debugging and troubleshooting, as well as workplace skills like cross-team collaboration. 

At Michigan, I'm currently taking advanced CE courseowkr in VLSI design, computer architecture, FPGA/logic design, and more. I'm eager to continue deepening my skills through advanced digital design and hardware courses in the future. I also plan to continue into graduate studies. 

I’m most interested in roles that sit at the intersection of **hardware design, firmware development, and systems engineering**—fields that blend hands-on technical problem-solving with scalable design thinking.
