Currently, I'm working on a project that MSU students will be able to use for nutritional data, based on what is being served in our dining halls. Though, it is a work in progress, so be sure to check back soon. 

The general overview of the project is as follows:

* Acquire the daily dining hall menu data from MSU's EatAtState website, and then categorize foods into groups. 
* Categorize foods into groups, and estimate average serving portions
* Calculate an estimated nutritional label, containg values such as caloric content, protein, vitamins, carbs, etc. 
* Host a website in which students can view the dining hall menus alongside their respective nutritional information.
