Hello, I am Rishabh Bhattarai, a current computer engineering student at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan. I grew up in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and have always been passionate about advancing the stages of computing. My current goal is to work towards a PhD in computer engineering, and work in a field such as semiconductor or VLSI design. 

On campus, I participate in multiple organizations to gain exposure to tech outside of just my classes. Mainly, I am a member of the MSU Autonomous Vehicles Club, in which we research and design software for autonomous driving applications. I also actively participate in MSU's AI Club. Furthermore, I will be eagerly looking for research positions within this following year, hopefully within the field of hardware engineering or embedded systems. 

With over three years of experience in IT, I am currently working as a SharePoint Developer at the Michigan State University Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, where I develop solutions for automating business tasks. My diverse experiences reflect my dedication to the field of computer engineering and my drive to innovate.
