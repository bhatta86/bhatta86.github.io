Hello, I am Rishabh Bhattarai, a current computer engineering student at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan. I grew up in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and have always been passionate about advancing the stages of computing. I aspire to become a chip design engineer and possibly pursue a PhD to work in the field of quantum computing.

Throughout my studies, I've completed various semester-long research projects, which you can explore in the research section of my website. Additionally, I am actively involved in the Autonomous Vehicles Club at MSU, a field that greatly interests me.

With over three years of experience in IT, I am currently working as a SharePoint Designer at the Michigan State University Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, where I develop solutions for automating business tasks. My diverse experiences reflect my dedication to the field of computer engineering and my drive to innovate.
