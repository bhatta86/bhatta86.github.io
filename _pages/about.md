Hello, I'm Rishabh Bhattarai, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Michigan College of Engineering. Originally from Kalamazoo, Michigan, I've always been passionate about computers and technology. My ultimate goal is to pursue higher education in engineering and build a career in the VLSI industry. 

I began my educational journey at Michigan State University, and transferred to the University of Michigan in my sophomore year. In my time at MSU, I was a member of the Autonomous Vehicles Club, contributing to research/development for autonomous driving systems, as well as the MSU AI Club, where I learned of many emerging technologies in the field. Moving forward at the University of Michigan, I am a member of MASA, the Michigan Aeronautical Science Association, and I'm eagerly looking for CompE related research opportunities on campus. 

I have three years of diverse IT experience. During my positions, I've honed skills in many different branches such as communication, hardware/software troubleshooting, Microsoft SharePoint Online and Power Platform skills, and more. Additionally, I have experience with project management, team collaboration, and designing efficient solutions to technical problems. Combining my academic and professional pursuits, I am driven to make an impact in the evolving field of computer engineering.
